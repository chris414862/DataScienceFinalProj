This method is intended for background tasks and services where the user should not be immediately interrupted with a password prompt. If a previously generated auth token is cached for this account and type then it is returned. Otherwise if a saved password is available it is sent to the server to generate a new auth token. Otherwise an Intent is returned which when started will prompt the user for a password. If the notifyAuthFailure parameter is set a status bar notification is also created with the same Intent alerting the user that they need to enter a password at some point. In that case you may need to wait until the user responds which could take hours or days or forever. When the user does respond and supply a new password the account manager will broadcast the LOGIN_ACCOUNTS_CHANGED_ACTION Intent and notify OnAccountsUpdateListener which applications can use to try again. If notifyAuthFailure is not set it is the application's responsibility to launch the returned Intent at some point. Either way the result from this call will not wait for user action. Some authenticators have auth token types whose value is authenticator-dependent. Some services use different token types to access different functionality -- for example Google uses different auth tokens to access Gmail and Google Calendar for the same account.

      "ORIGINAL:  Similar to schedule(JobInfo) but allows you to enqueue work for a new or existing job. If a job with the same ID is already scheduled it will be replaced with the new JobInfo but any previously enqueued work will remain and be dispatched the next time it runs. If a job with the same ID is already running the new work will be enqueued for it. The work you enqueue is later retrieved through JobParameters#dequeueWork() . Be sure to see there about how to process work; the act of enqueueing work changes how you should handle the overall lifecycle of an executing job. It is strongly encouraged that you use the same JobInfo for all work you enqueue. This will allow the system to optimally schedule work along with any pending and/or currently running work. If the JobInfo changes from the last time the job was enqueued the system will need to update the associated JobInfo which can cause a disruption in execution. In particular this can result in any currently running job that is processing previous work to be stopped and restarted with the new JobInfo. It is recommended that you avoid using JobInfo.Builder#setExtras(PersistableBundle) or JobInfo.Builder#setTransientExtras(Bundle) with a JobInfo you are using to enqueue work. The system will try to compare these extras with the previous JobInfo but there are situations where it may get this wrong and count the JobInfo as changing. (That said you should be relatively safe with a simple set of consistent data in these fields.) You should never use JobInfo.Builder#setClipData(ClipData int) with work you are enqueue since currently this will always be treated as a different JobInfo even if the ClipData contents are exactly the same.\n",

      "ORIGINAL:  Returns the String representation of this BigDecimal modified by layout parameters and allowing exponential notation. This method is provided as a primitive for use by more sophisticated classes such as DecimalFormat that can apply locale-sensitive editing of the result. The level of formatting that it provides is a necessary part of the BigDecimal class as it is sensitive to and must follow the calculation and rounding rules for BigDecimal arithmetic. However if the function is provided elsewhere it may be removed from this class. The parameters are all of type int . A value of -1 for any parameter indicates that the default action or value for that parameter should be used. The first two parameters ( before and after ) specify the number of characters to be used for the integer part and decimal part of the result respectively as defined for format(int int) . If either of these is -1 (which indicates the default action) the number of characters used will be exactly as many as are needed for that part. The remaining parameters control the use of exponential notation and rounding. Three ( explaces exdigits and exform ) control the exponent part of the result. As before the default action for any of these parameters may be selected by using the value -1. explaces must be a positive number; it sets the number of places (digits after the sign of the exponent) to be used for any exponent part the default (when explaces is -1) being to use as many as are needed. If explaces is not -1 space is always reserved for an exponent; if one is not needed (for example if the exponent will be 0) then explaces +2 blanks are appended to the result. (This preserves vertical alignment of similarly formatted numbers in a monospace font.) If explaces is not -1 and is not large enough to contain the exponent an exception is thrown. exdigits sets the trigger point for use of exponential notation. If before any rounding the number of places needed before the decimal point exceeds exdigits or if the absolute value of the result is less than 0.000001 then exponential form will be used provided that exdigits was specified. When exdigits is -1 exponential notation will never be used. If 0 is specified for exdigits exponential notation is always used unless the exponent would be 0. exform sets the form for exponential notation (if needed). It may be either MathContext#SCIENTIFIC or MathContext#ENGINEERING . If the latter engineering form is requested up to three digits (plus sign if negative) may be needed for the integer part of the result ( before ). Otherwise only one digit (plus sign if negative) is needed. Finally the sixth argument exround selects the rounding algorithm to be used and must be one of the values indicated by a public constant in the MathContext class whose name starts with ROUND_ . The default ( ROUND_HALF_UP ) may also be selected by using the value -1 as before. The special value MathContext.ROUND_UNNECESSARY may be used to detect whether non-zero digits are discarded -- if exround has this value than if non-zero digits would be discarded (rounded) during formatting then an ArithmeticException is thrown.\n",

      "ORIGINAL:  Get the stall duration for the format/size combination (in nanoseconds). format should be one of the ones returned by getOutputFormats() . size should be one of the ones returned by getOutputSizes(int) . A stall duration is how much extra time would get added to the normal minimum frame duration for a repeating request that has streams with non-zero stall. For example consider JPEG captures which have the following characteristics: JPEG streams act like processed YUV streams in requests for which they are not included; in requests in which they are directly referenced they act as JPEG streams. This is because supporting a JPEG stream requires the underlying YUV data to always be ready for use by a JPEG encoder but the encoder will only be used (and impact frame duration) on requests that actually reference a JPEG stream. The JPEG processor can run concurrently to the rest of the camera pipeline but cannot process more than 1 capture at a time. In other words using a repeating YUV request would result in a steady frame rate (let's say it's 30 FPS). If a single JPEG request is submitted periodically the frame rate will stay at 30 FPS (as long as we wait for the previous JPEG to return each time). If we try to submit a repeating YUV + JPEG request then the frame rate will drop from 30 FPS. In general submitting a new request with a non-0 stall time stream will not cause a frame rate drop unless there are still outstanding buffers for that stream from previous requests. Submitting a repeating request with streams (call this S ) is the same as setting the minimum frame duration from the normal minimum frame duration corresponding to S added with the maximum stall duration for S . If interleaving requests with and without a stall duration a request will stall by the maximum of the remaining times for each can-stall stream with outstanding buffers. This means that a stalling request will not have an exposure start until the stall has completed. This should correspond to the stall duration when only that stream is active with all processing (typically in android.*.mode ) set to FAST or OFF . Setting any of the processing modes to HIGH_QUALITY effectively results in an indeterminate stall duration for all streams in a request (the regular stall calculation rules are ignored). The following formats may always have a stall duration: ImageFormat#JPEG ImageFormat#RAW_SENSOR ImageFormat#RAW_PRIVATE The following formats will never have a stall duration: ImageFormat#YUV_420_888 Implementation-Defined All other formats may or may not have an allowed stall duration on a per-capability basis; refer to CameraCharacteristics#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES for more details.

You can return any object you like here including the activity instance itself which can later be retrieved by calling getLastNonConfigurationInstance() in the new activity instance. If you are targeting Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB or later consider instead using a Fragment with Fragment#setRetainInstance(boolean) . This function is called purely as an optimization and you must not rely on it being called. When it is called a number of guarantees will be made to help optimize configuration switching: The function will be called between onStop() and onDestroy() . A new instance of the activity will always be immediately created after this one's onDestroy() is called. In particular no messages will be dispatched during this time (when the returned object does not have an activity to be associated with). The object you return here will always be available from the getLastNonConfigurationInstance() method of the following activity instance as described there. These guarantees are designed so that an activity can use this API to propagate extensive state from the old to new activity instance from loaded bitmaps to network connections to evenly actively running threads. Note that you should not propagate any data that may change based on the configuration including any data loaded from resources such as strings layouts or drawables. The guarantee of no message handling during the switch to the next activity simplifies use with active objects. For example if your retained state is an AsyncTask you are guaranteed that its call back functions (like AsyncTask.onPostExecute(Result) ) will not be called from the call here until you execute the next instance's onCreate(android.os.Bundle) . (Note however that there is of course no such guarantee for AsyncTask.doInBackground(Params...) since that is running in a separate thread.) Note: For most cases you should use the Fragment API Fragment#setRetainInstance(boolean) instead; this is also available on older platforms through the Android support libraries.\n",

      "ORIGINAL:  Gets the received GNSS satellite time at the measurement time in nanoseconds. The received satellite time is relative to the beginning of the system week for all constellations except for Glonass where it is relative to the beginning of the Glonass system day. The table below indicates the valid range of the received GNSS satellite time. These ranges depend on the constellation and code being tracked and the state of the tracking algorithms given by the getState() method. The minimum value of this field is zero. The maximum value of this field is determined by looking across all of the state flags that are set for the given constellation and code type and finding the the maximum value in this table. For example for GPS L1 C/A if STATE_TOW_KNOWN is set this field can be any value from 0 to 1 week (in nanoseconds) and for GAL E1B code if only STATE_GAL_E1BC_CODE_LOCK is set then this field can be any value from 0 to 4 milliseconds (in nanoseconds.) Note: TOW Known refers to the case where TOW is possibly not decoded over the air but has been determined from other sources. If TOW decoded is set then TOW Known must also be set. Note well: if there is any ambiguity in integer millisecond STATE_MSEC_AMBIGUOUS must be set accordingly in the 'state' field. This value must be populated unless the 'state' == STATE_UNKNOWN. Note on optional flags: For L1 C/A and B1I STATE_SYMBOL_SYNC is optional since the symbol length is the same as the bit length. For L5Q and E5aQ STATE_BIT_SYNC and STATE_SYMBOL_SYNC are optional since they are implied by STATE_CODE_LOCK. STATE_2ND_CODE_LOCK for L5I is optional since it is implied by STATE_SYMBOL_SYNC. STATE_2ND_CODE_LOCK for E1C is optional since it is implied by STATE_GAL_E1C_2ND_CODE_LOCK. For E1B and E1C STATE_SYMBOL_SYNC is optional because it is implied by STATE_GAL_E1BC_CODE_LOCK.\n",

The input Image could be from ImageReader (acquired via ImageReader#acquireNextImage or ImageReader#acquireLatestImage ) or from this ImageWriter (acquired via dequeueInputImage() ). In the former case the Image data will be moved to this ImageWriter. Note that the Image properties (size format strides etc.) must be the same as the properties of the images dequeued from this ImageWriter or this method will throw an IllegalArgumentException . In the latter case the application has filled the input image with data. This method then passes the filled buffer to the downstream consumer. In both cases it's up to the caller to ensure that the Image timestamp (in nanoseconds) is correctly set as the downstream component may want to use it to indicate the Image data capture time. After this method is called and the downstream consumer consumes and releases the Image an OnImageReleasedListener#onImageReleased callback will fire. The application can use this callback to avoid sending Images faster than the downstream consumer processing rate in steady state. Passing in an Image from some other component (e.g. an ImageReader ) requires a free input Image from this ImageWriter as the destination. In this case this call will block as dequeueInputImage() does if there are no free Images available. To avoid blocking the application should ensure that there is at least one free Image available in this ImageWriter before calling this method. After this call the input Image is no longer valid for further access as if the Image is Image#close .

      "ORIGINAL:  This method was deprecated in API level 29. For IMEs that have already implemented features like customizable/downloadable keyboard layouts/languages please start migration to other approaches. One idea would be exposing only one unified InputMethodSubtype then implement IME's own language switching mechanism within that unified subtype. The support of \"Additional Subtype\" may be completely dropped in a future version of Android. Set additional input method subtypes. Only a process which shares the same uid with the IME can add additional input method subtypes to the IME. Please note that a subtype's status is stored in the system. For example enabled subtypes are remembered by the framework even after they are removed by using this method. If you re-add the same subtypes again they will just get enabled. If you want to avoid such conflicts for instance you may want to create a \"different\" new subtype even with the same locale and mode by changing its extra value. The different subtype won't get affected by the stored past status. (You may want to take a look at InputMethodSubtype#hashCode() to refer to the current implementation.) NOTE: If the same subtype exists in both the manifest XML file and additional subtypes specified by subtypes those multiple instances are automatically merged into one instance. CAVEAT: In API Level 23 and prior the system may do nothing if an empty InputMethodSubtype is specified in subtypes which prevents you from removing the last one entry of additional subtypes.

      "ORIGINAL:  Sets the distance along the Z axis (orthogonal to the X/Y plane on which views are drawn) from the camera to this view. The camera's distance affects 3D transformations for instance rotations around the X and Y axis. If the rotationX or rotationY properties are changed and this view is large (more than half the size of the screen) it is recommended to always use a camera distance that's greater than the height (X axis rotation) or the width (Y axis rotation) of this view. The distance of the camera from the view plane can have an affect on the perspective distortion of the view when it is rotated around the x or y axis. For example a large distance will result in a large viewing angle and there will not be much perspective distortion of the view as it rotates. A short distance may cause much more perspective distortion upon rotation and can also result in some drawing artifacts if the rotated view ends up partially behind the camera (which is why the recommendation is to use a distance at least as far as the size of the view if the view is to be rotated.) The distance is expressed in \"depth pixels.\" The default distance depends on the screen density. For instance on a medium density display the default distance is 1280. On a high density display the default distance is 1920. If you want to specify a distance that leads to visually consistent results across various densities use the following formula: The density scale factor of a high density display is 1.5 and 1920 = 1280 * 1.5.\n",

      "ORIGINAL:  This method was deprecated in API level 20. As of API 20 use dispatchApplyWindowInsets(android.view.WindowInsets) to apply insets to views. Views should override onApplyWindowInsets(android.view.WindowInsets) or use setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(android.view.View.OnApplyWindowInsetsListener) to implement handling their own insets. Called by the view hierarchy when the content insets for a window have changed to allow it to adjust its content to fit within those windows. The content insets tell you the space that the status bar input method and other system windows infringe on the application's window. You do not normally need to deal with this function since the default window decoration given to applications takes care of applying it to the content of the window. If you use SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN or SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION this will not be the case and your content can be placed under those system elements. You can then use this method within your view hierarchy if you have parts of your UI which you would like to ensure are not being covered. The default implementation of this method simply applies the content insets to the view's padding consuming that content (modifying the insets to be 0) and returning true. This behavior is off by default but can be enabled through setFitsSystemWindows(boolean) . This function's traversal down the hierarchy is depth-first. The same content insets object is propagated down the hierarchy so any changes made to it will be seen by all following views (including potentially ones above in the hierarchy since this is a depth-first traversal). The first view that returns true will abort the entire traversal. The default implementation works well for a situation where it is used with a container that covers the entire window allowing it to apply the appropriate insets to its content on all edges. If you need a more complicated layout (such as two different views fitting system windows one on the top of the window and one on the bottom) you can override the method and handle the insets however you would like. Note that the insets provided by the framework are always relative to the far edges of the window not accounting for the location of the called view within that window. (In fact when this method is called you do not yet know where the layout will place the view as it is done before layout happens.) Note: unlike many View methods there is no dispatch phase to this call. If you are overriding it in a ViewGroup and want to allow the call to continue to your children you must be sure to call the super implementation. Here is a sample layout that makes use of fitting system windows to have controls for a video view placed inside of the window decorations that it hides and shows. This can be used with code like the second sample (video player) shown in setSystemUiVisibility(int) .\n",

      "ORIGINAL:  Returns a string map view of this process builder's environment. Whenever a process builder is created the environment is initialized to a copy of the current process environment (see System#getenv() ). Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's start() method will use this map as their environment. The returned object may be modified using ordinary Map operations. These modifications will be visible to subprocesses started via the start() method. Two ProcessBuilder instances always contain independent process environments so changes to the returned map will never be reflected in any other ProcessBuilder instance or the values returned by System#getenv . If the system does not support environment variables an empty map is returned. The returned map does not permit null keys or values. Attempting to insert or query the presence of a null key or value will throw a NullPointerException . Attempting to query the presence of a key or value which is not of type String will throw a ClassCastException . The behavior of the returned map is system-dependent. A system may not allow modifications to environment variables or may forbid certain variable names or values. For this reason attempts to modify the map may fail with UnsupportedOperationException or IllegalArgumentException if the modification is not permitted by the operating system. Since the external format of environment variable names and values is system-dependent there may not be a one-to-one mapping between them and Java's Unicode strings. Nevertheless the map is implemented in such a way that environment variables which are not modified by Java code will have an unmodified native representation in the subprocess. The returned map and its collection views may not obey the general contract of the Object#equals and Object#hashCode methods. The returned map is typically case-sensitive on all platforms.

If a security manager exists its SecurityManager#checkPermission method is called with a RuntimePermission (\"getenv.\"+name) permission. This may result in a SecurityException being thrown. If no exception is thrown the value of the variable name is returned. System properties and environment variables are both conceptually mappings between names and values. Both mechanisms can be used to pass user-defined information to a Java process. Environment variables have a more global effect because they are visible to all descendants of the process which defines them not just the immediate Java subprocess. They can have subtly different semantics such as case insensitivity on different operating systems. For these reasons environment variables are more likely to have unintended side effects. It is best to use system properties where possible. Environment variables should be used when a global effect is desired or when an external system interface requires an environment variable (such as PATH ). On UNIX systems the alphabetic case of name is typically significant while on Microsoft Windows systems it is typically not. For example the expression System.getenv(\"FOO\").equals(System.getenv(\"foo\")) is likely to be true on Microsoft Windows.\n",

If any of the objects previously protected by these monitors were in an inconsistent state the damaged objects become visible to other threads potentially resulting in arbitrary behavior. Many uses of stop should be replaced by code that simply modifies some variable to indicate that the target thread should stop running. The target thread should check this variable regularly and return from its run method in an orderly fashion if the variable indicates that it is to stop running.

      "ORIGINAL:  Parses text from a string to produce a Number . The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by pos . If parsing succeeds then the index of pos is updated to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily use all characters up to the end of the string) and the parsed number is returned. The updated pos can be used to indicate the starting point for the next call to this method. If an error occurs then the index of pos is not changed the error index of pos is set to the index of the character where the error occurred and null is returned. The subclass returned depends on the value of isParseBigDecimal() as well as on the string being parsed. If isParseBigDecimal() is false (the default) most integer values are returned as Long objects no matter how they are written: \"17\" and \"17.000\" both parse to Long(17) . Values that cannot fit into a Long are returned as Double s. This includes values with a fractional part infinite values NaN and the value -0.0. DecimalFormat does not decide whether to return a Double or a Long based on the presence of a decimal separator in the source string. Doing so would prevent integers that overflow the mantissa of a double such as \"-9223372036854775808.00\" from being parsed accurately. Callers may use the Number methods doubleValue longValue etc. to obtain the type they want. If isParseBigDecimal() is true values are returned as BigDecimal objects. The values are the ones constructed by BigDecimal.BigDecimal(String) for corresponding strings in locale-independent format. The special cases negative and positive infinity and NaN are returned as Double instances holding the values of the corresponding Double constants. DecimalFormat parses all Unicode characters that represent decimal digits as defined by Character.digit() .

After invoking Collections.rotate(list 1) (or Collections.rotate(list -4) ) list will comprise [s t a n k] . Note that this method can usefully be applied to sublists to move one or more elements within a list while preserving the order of the remaining elements. For example the following idiom moves the element at index j forward to position k (which must be greater than or equal to j ): To move more than one element forward increase the absolute value of the rotation distance. To move elements backward use a positive shift distance. If the specified list is small or implements the RandomAccess interface this implementation exchanges the first element into the location it should go and then repeatedly exchanges the displaced element into the location it should go until a displaced element is swapped into the first element. If necessary the process is repeated on the second and successive elements until the rotation is complete. If the specified list is large and doesn't implement the RandomAccess interface this implementation breaks the list into two sublist views around index -distance mod size . Then the reverse(java.util.List) method is invoked on each sublist view and finally it is invoked on the entire list.

      "ORIGINAL:  This method was deprecated in API level 15. As of JDK version 1.1 replaced by DateFormat.parse(String s) . Attempts to interpret the string s as a representation of a date and time. If the attempt is successful the time indicated is returned represented as the distance measured in milliseconds of that time from the epoch (00:00:00 GMT on January 1 1970). If the attempt fails an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. It accepts many syntaxes; in particular it recognizes the IETF standard date syntax: \"Sat 12 Aug 1995 13:30:00 GMT\". It also understands the continental U.S. time-zone abbreviations but for general use a time-zone offset should be used: \"Sat 12 Aug 1995 13:30:00 GMT+0430\" (4 hours 30 minutes west of the Greenwich meridian). If no time zone is specified the local time zone is assumed. GMT and UTC are considered equivalent. The string s is processed from left to right looking for data of interest. Any material in s that is within the ASCII parenthesis characters ( and ) is ignored. Parentheses may be nested. Otherwise the only characters permitted within s are these ASCII characters: A consecutive sequence of decimal digits is treated as a decimal number: If a number is preceded by + or - and a year has already been recognized then the number is a time-zone offset. If the number is less than 24 it is an offset measured in hours. Otherwise it is regarded as an offset in minutes expressed in 24-hour time format without punctuation. A preceding - means a westward offset. Time zone offsets are always relative to UTC (Greenwich). Thus for example -5 occurring in the string would mean \"five hours west of Greenwich\" and +0430 would mean \"four hours and thirty minutes east of Greenwich.\" It is permitted for the string to specify GMT UT or UTC redundantly-for example GMT-5 or utc+0430 . The number is regarded as a year number if one of the following conditions is true: The number is equal to or greater than 70 and followed by a space comma slash or end of string The number is less than 70 and both a month and a day of the month have already been recognized If the recognized year number is less than 100 it is interpreted as an abbreviated year relative to a century of which dates are within 80 years before and 19 years after the time when the Date class is initialized. After adjusting the year number 1900 is subtracted from it. For example if the current year is 1999 then years in the range 19 to 99 are assumed to mean 1919 to 1999 while years from 0 to 18 are assumed to mean 2000 to 2018. Note that this is slightly different from the interpretation of years less than 100 that is used in SimpleDateFormat . The number is equal to or greater than 70 and followed by a space comma slash or end of string The number is less than 70 and both a month and a day of the month have already been recognized If the number is followed by a colon it is regarded as an hour unless an hour has already been recognized in which case it is regarded as a minute. If the number is followed by a slash it is regarded as a month (it is decreased by 1 to produce a number in the range 0 to 11 ) unless a month has already been recognized in which case it is regarded as a day of the month. If the number is followed by whitespace a comma a hyphen or end of string then if an hour has been recognized but not a minute it is regarded as a minute; otherwise if a minute has been recognized but not a second it is regarded as a second; otherwise it is regarded as a day of the month. A consecutive sequence of letters is regarded as a word and treated as follows: A word that matches AM ignoring case is ignored (but the parse fails if an hour has not been recognized or is less than 1 or greater than 12 ). A word that matches PM ignoring case adds 12 to the hour (but the parse fails if an hour has not been recognized or is less than 1 or greater than 12 ). Any word that matches any prefix of SUNDAY MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY FRIDAY or SATURDAY ignoring case is ignored. For example sat Friday TUE and Thurs are ignored. Otherwise any word that matches any prefix of JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL MAY JUNE JULY AUGUST SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER or DECEMBER ignoring case and considering them in the order given here is recognized as specifying a month and is converted to a number ( 0 to 11 ). For example aug Sept april and NOV are recognized as months. So is Ma which is recognized as MARCH not MAY . Any word that matches GMT UT or UTC ignoring case is treated as referring to UTC. Any word that matches EST CST MST or PST ignoring case is recognized as referring to the time zone in North America that is five six seven or eight hours west of Greenwich respectively. Any word that matches EDT CDT MDT or PDT ignoring case is recognized as referring to the same time zone respectively during daylight saving time. Once the entire string s has been scanned it is converted to a time result in one of two ways. If a time zone or time-zone offset has been recognized then the year month day of month hour minute and second are interpreted in UTC and then the time-zone offset is applied. Otherwise the year month day of month hour minute and second are interpreted in the local time zone.\n",

Autofill options ( ViewStructure#setAutofillOptions(CharSequence[]) ) when the view can only be filled with predefined values (typically used when the autofill type is AUTOFILL_TYPE_LIST ). Resource id ( ViewStructure#setId(int String String String) ). Class name ( ViewStructure#setClassName(String) ). Content description ( ViewStructure#setContentDescription(CharSequence) ).
